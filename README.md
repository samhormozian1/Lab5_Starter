1. Unit testing is not the best choice for testing the "message" feature of a messaging application because it focuses on individual components rather than interactions between components
2. Yes, using a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application is appropriate because this feature involves a specific, isolated functionality that can be easily tested in isolation. Unit tests are ideal for ensuring that the function correctly limits message input to 80 characters and handles cases both at and beyond this limit, such as truncating input or displaying an error.
